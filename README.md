# Algorithmic Patterns

This repository contains curated solutions to a subset of common algorithmic problems, primarily based on the LeetCode 75 study plan.

The purpose of this repository is **to maintain algorithmic fluency and document common problem-solving patterns** that frequently appear in technical interviews and real-world engineering tasks.

This is not intended as a competitive programming showcase, but rather as a structured reference for fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## 📌 Scope

The problems cover a range of foundational algorithmic topics, including:
- Arrays and strings
- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Prefix sums
- Hash-based data structures
- Stack and queue
- Basic graph and traversal patterns

Each solution focuses on:
- clarity and readability
- explicit time and space complexity
- well-known algorithmic patterns rather than clever tricks

## 🔎 Notes

This repository complements my primary work in **machine learning and LLM-based systems**, where a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures remains essential for building reliable and scalable production systems.
